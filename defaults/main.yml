# Set the package install state for distribution packages

# to use Ceph in OSA, you need to
# - have the needed pools and a client user (for glance, cinder and/or nova)
#   pre-provisioned in your ceph cluster; OSA assumes to have root access to
#   the monitor hosts
# - configure / overrules following defaults in osa's user config
# - some ceph specific vars are (also) part of other role defaults:
#   * glance
#   * nova
# - cinder gets configured with ceph if there are cinder backends defined with
#   the rbd driver (see openstack_user_config.yml.example)

# The ceph_pkg_source variable controls the install source for the Ceph packages.
# Valid values include:
#   * ceph This option installs Ceph from a ceph.com repo.  Additional variables to
#          adjust items such as Ceph release and regional download mirror can be found
#          in vars/*.yml
#
#   * distro This options installs Ceph from the operating system's default repository and
#            unlike the other options does not attempt to manage package keys or add additional
#            package repositories.
