deprecations:
  - |
    Format of ``client`` key inside ``ceph_extra_components`` variable has been
    deprecated in favor of a mapping with one required attribute ``name``.
    Having ``client`` key defined as a simple list is kept for backwards compatibility
    but will be removed in future releases.

fixes:
  - |
    Backwards compatibility of ``client`` key inside ``ceph_extra_components`` variable
    has been fixed to support both a list and a list of mappings.
