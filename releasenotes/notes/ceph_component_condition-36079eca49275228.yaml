features:
  - |
    Added support for ``condition`` key for ``ceph_extra_components`` mapping,
    which could be used to define a more narrow conditions when component
    should be having ceph mappings.
  - |
    Introduced variable ``ceph_cinder_backup_enabled`` which can be manually
    overriden to enable provisionment of Ceph client to ``cinder-backup``
    service. Previously logic for this has been hardcoded and not easily
    overridable.
